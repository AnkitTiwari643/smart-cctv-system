## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Camera connectivity issues** - Mitigate with robust reconnection logic
2. **Performance on old hardware** - Mitigate with optimization and fallback options
3. **Alert false positives** - Mitigate with tunable confidence thresholds
4. **Bluetooth reliability** - Mitigate with fallback to wired speaker

### Contingency Plans
- If performance insufficient: Use lighter model (YOLOv8n), reduce resolution
- If distance calculation inaccurate: Fall back to simple detection without distance
- If hardware inadequate: Document upgrade path
